# sortcards

The file named sorted_cards_new_day.pyw copies the excel spreadsheet (with an attached macro) and places it in a folder it also creates and renames the file and folder with the current date.

The excel spreadsheet contains 2 macros.  The sortCards macro sorts cards based on card number, removes all non-numeric characters, tests for invalid card numbers, and copies the two different card types (gift and trade) to their own sheets.  The saveSortedCards macro saves the gift card and trade card sheets to their own respective files.

I have copied the macros to text files for easier viewing, they are in the sortcards script folder along with the excel spreadsheet.

trade card timing for 60 cards:

8:36 before script = 8.6 minutes = .1433 hrs

3:47 after script = 3.7833 minutes = .0631 hrs

.0631/.1433 = 44% as much time
