Instructions to SortCards script:

- Open the excel file named SortCards.xlsm and save as a different file in a new folder in the parent folder 

- The naming convention for the new file and new folder has thus far been "Sorted Cards yyyy-mm-dd"

- Make sure to navigate to the Scanned Cards workbook and start on the first unused cell in row A when you swipe

- Make sure that all cards scan correctly, if not then manually type the card number in

- Every so often it is wise to sort the cards, so that if there are any errors then it is easy to find out which card that error pertains to
	navigate to the Developer tab -> and click Macros, a window will pop up, double click sortCards
	this script will sort the cards into two separate workbooks: Trade Cards and Gift Cards

- When finished sorting cards, save the sorted lists as their own files, ready to be uploaded by rePortal
	navigate to the Developer tab -> Macros, a window will pop up, double click saveSortedLists
	this script will save the Gift Cards and Trade Cards workbooks as their own files: GC_list.csv and TC_list.csv

- Copy GC_list.csv to the network folder xxxxxx and TC_list.csv to the network folder xxxxxx

- Zero out the trade and gift cards by opening xxxxxx, log in, and navigate to  IT Maintenance
	there you will see Gift Card Zero and Trade Card Zero
	Zero out the cards by clicking either menu item and then the sub item named Run [Gift/Trade] Card Proc
	finish by zeroing out the other set of gift/trade cards

- Copy the completed folder (Sorted Cards yyyy-mm-dd) to the done folder

NOTE:
	The script stops sorting once it hits a blank line, so if you scan to some cells, skip a cell, and then scan the rest of the card numbers, uh-oh
	The script will stop once it hits the blank spot and see that as the end of the list
